Analyzing users brainwaves to make decisions

Using a simple game called MindFlex, a toy by Mattel which apparently used brain waves to steer a ball through an obstacle course. 
The brain waves are captured with the enclosed EEG headset, which allows the user to speed up or slow down a fan, 
thus lifting or lowering the blue styrofoam ball. Supporters of the game believe that the headset does read EEGs 
(it uses the same chip as the MindSet from NeuroSky and has been used in homebuilt EEG machines). We have applied the hardware 
to a arduino and pulls the serial port reading that will Tinderize cute and adorable kittens. The development of Cat-Tinder or 
"Pawndr," is a place holder for cognitive behavior development and marketing for social and business solutions.
